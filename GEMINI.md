## Project Overview

This project is a "Christmas House-of-Games" web application, designed as a light-hearted quiz tournament for families. The application is intended to be a Progressive Web App (PWA), work on any phone or laptop, and be free to host. A key feature is an AI Question-Master to help the host generate new quiz rounds on the fly.

The application will feature:
*   Round-based quizzes with various formats.
*   Support for multiple teams and players.
*   A real-time scoreboard.
*   OAuth login with Google and Apple.
*   A "Host mode" for controlling the game.
*   A question bank with AI-generated questions.
*   Offline capabilities.
*   A festive theme.

## Building and Running

**TODO:** Add instructions on how to build and run the project once the development environment is set up.

## Development Conventions

*   **Data Model:** The data model is defined in `xmas2025_prd.md` and uses a JSON-based structure.
*   **Festive Theme:** The application should have a festive theme, including snowfall CSS, Santa avatars, and sound effects.
*   **PWA:** The application should be a Progressive Web App (PWA) to ensure offline capabilities and avoid the need for an app store installation.
